in users.js

change these parameters

change get to post

change description

console.log(' user route' )


using body parser 

-which is already included in the express now

- using middleware now



//in server.js

initilising middleware

app.use(express.json({extended: false}))

to get the data in req body


go to postman and make post req

in header 

-> add key - content-type
    application-json

    body- raw json
    {
        "name:"brad"


    }


    -send whatever data we want



here we validate the input by checking if the user had the right data or not

`express validator does this


const { check , validationResults } = require('express-validator/check')


-check express-validator documentation

next checking if the name is present in the request

check('name','Name is reuired').not().isEmpty()


do it for rest of the fields as well


.isEmail()

.isLength({min:6})


use error handling aswll

we could connect with this react alsoo


-->save these data inside postman
